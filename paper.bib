{In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of first-order proof
procedures when used as tactics for proving subgoals in a higher-order
logic interactive theorem prover. We first motivate why such
first-order proof tactics are useful, and then describe the core
integrating technology: an `LCF-style' logical kernel for clausal
first-order logic. This allows the choice of different logical
mappings between higher-order logic and first-order logic to be used
depending on the subgoal, and also enables several different
first-order proof procedures to cooperate on constructing the proof.
This work was carried out using the HOL4 theorem prover; we comment on
the ease of transferring the technology to other higher-order logic
theorem provers.}

  abstract =
{Interactive theorem proving is tackling ever larger formalization and
verification projects, and there is a critical need for theory
engineering techniques to support these efforts. One such technique is
cross-prover package management, which has the potential to simplify
the development of logical theories and effectively share theories
between different theorem prover implementations. The OpenTheory
project has developed standards for packaging theories of the higher
order logic implemented by the HOL family of theorem provers. What is
currently missing is a standard theory library that can serve as a
published contract of interoperability and contain proofs of basic
properties that would otherwise appear in many theory packages. The
core contribution of this paper is the presentation of a standard
theory library for higher order logic represented as an OpenTheory
package. We identify the core theory set of the HOL family of theorem
provers, and describe the process of instrumenting the HOL Light
theorem prover to extract a standardized version of its core theory
development. We profile the axioms and theorems of our standard theory
library and investigate the performance cost of separating the
standard theory library into coherent hierarchical theory packages.}
