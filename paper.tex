\begin{abstract}
Tactics, functions that compute low-level inferences to achieve a high-level reasoning goal, are usually developed within and tied to a particular proof assistant, which leads to code duplication across different systems and inhibits reuse.
As formal methods are applied to larger problems, projects spanning multiple proof assistants benefit more from interoperability and access to the union of all implemented tactics.
Using the OpenTheory proof exchange format, we show how to turn a tactic implemented for one system into one available to many via the web.
This enables, for example, LCF-style proof reconstruction efforts for fast automatic provers to be shared by users of multiple proof assistants and removes the need for each user to install the automatic prover.

\section{Introduction}

\section{Tactics in Proof Assistants}

Examples of proof assistants.
Examples of tactics.
Examples of duplication.

\section{\OpenTheory for Tactic Communication}

Introduction to article format.
Representing terms and proofs in the format.
Viewing tactics as derived inference rules.

\section{Making Existing Tactics into Web Services}

Implementation details to make standalone.
Implementation details to put on the web.
Examples of tactics for which it is done: HolQbf, HolSmt, HolSat, sledgehammer, TFL, function package, Metis, datatype packages, arithmetic decision procedure.

\section{Performance}

Speed comparisons against using built-in tactics.
Amount of code and time required, compared to porting tactics at the implementation level.

\section{Related Work}

Evidential tool bus.
System on TPTP.
Natural extension of the integration of automatic tools into interactive systems.

\section{Conclusions}

Additional (non-proof) work tactics might also do needs to be represented on another channel.
